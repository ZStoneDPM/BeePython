set virtualenv for your project first
this gist works using python 3.6

once in virtual env
#1
pip install -r requirements.txt

#2
cookiecutter https://github.com/pybee/briefcase-template

if you upload to pypi it could be turned into a python
package you get via pip

#3 - if not already installed
open in browser http://wixtoolset.org/releases/
install (windows via exe) windows wix toolset

python setup.py windows -s

if not finding windows now.. or other <os> -s
pip install briefcase 
#again.. and double check toga versions match 
#as per requirments.txt info
